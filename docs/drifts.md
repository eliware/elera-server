# Supervisor match drifts

Checklist against `elera-lab/core_flow.md`, `docs/supervisor_plan.md`, and the
applicable repository conventions. This is an audit record, not an assertion
that the implementation is complete.

## Current status

- [x] Local drain/lifecycle policy ownership and root-socket administration boundary are established.
- [x] The client dependency is intentionally development-only.
- [x] Recovery authority, lifecycle validation, and final supervisor gates are verified locally. Runtime lab validation remains separate.
- [x] Source-to-test audit found no non-barrel implementation module without a
      focused test. Six missing direct paths are documented intentional
      barrels/entrypoints/orchestrators.
- [x] Focused cold-recovery, observation, durable-store, and lifecycle tests
      pass with 100×4 coverage.
- [x] The previously reported recovery/data-directory coverage gaps are
      covered by focused tests.
- [x] Added focused edge-case coverage for candidate selection, recovery
      parsing, state files, and data-directory safety. Targeted recovery tests
      examine the previously reported branches.

## Actionable drifts

- [x] Local `file:../elera-lib` linking is intentional development state and
      remains until the published package is selected for release/deployment.
- [ ] Reconcile `docs/api-contracts.md` with the final no-legacy policy. Its
      compatibility/versioning section must describe only intentional protocol
      versioning, not support for obsolete formats or fallback behavior.
- [x] Removed the ambient `ELERA_CLUSTER_BOOTSTRAP` argument fallback. Bootstrap
      authority comes from the explicit startup/recovery decision passed through
      the coordinator. The environment variable remains only for the internal
      pending-initialization handoff.
- [x] Completed the narrow composition-root refactor. `src/main.mjs` serves as the
      dependency-wiring entrypoint. The README documents the supervisor/application/CLI/GitOps operations boundary.
- [x] Runtime SQL client composition is published into shared state before
      readiness and control routes execute. Invalid health query results fail
      closed, and initialization does not report success when metadata migration
      fails.
- [x] App-admin provisioning uses the canonical database, identity, and token
      endpoints with application-scoped authorization. Not approved applications
      remain fail-closed.
- [x] New startup preserves `SUPERVISOR_INTENT_JSON` while injecting runtime
      identity, so declared multi-member intent reaches the explicit bootstrap
      state machine rather than silently falling previous to a single-member default.
- [x] Root-only node data restore is guarded by exact identity/path binding,
      dry-run and confirmation requirements, readiness/quorum checks, recovery
      disposition, donor validation for resync, audit, and idempotency.
- [x] Pending/recovery startup exposes the same root-only restore endpoint while
      SQL is unavailable, with explicit offline resync and donor requirements.
- [x] Executing single-member resync restarts without bootstrap and verifies
      Synced/Primary readiness before reinclusion.
- [ ] Verify every recovery observation is authenticated, epoch-bound,
      evidence-digested, quorum-authorized, and rejected when stale or changed.
- [ ] Verify winner-only bootstrap, join-only followers, Primary verification,
      and clean-restart rejoin behavior with implementation-level tests.
- [ ] Verify shutdown ordering, operation refusal, drain events, MariaDB
      SIGTERM handling, timeout force-kill, and listener closure end to end.
- [ ] Verify the one-second health/assignment cycle and ten-second telemetry
      aggregation use cached state and do not query SQL from check handlers.
- [x] Added focused coverage for the supervisor drain-timeout policy uncovered
      by the current suite.
- [x] Reconciled the supervisor’s bundle and event validation with the shared
      `elera-lib` contracts, with credential-free `routing.topology` events.
- [x] Regenerated the source-to-test inventory and proved every non-barrel
      module has a matching focused test. Cross-cutting tests remain integration
      only.
- [x] Current supervisor `npm test` passes with 100×4 coverage and zero lint
      warnings. The broader source/test inventory remains under inspect.
- [x] Full supervisor suite re-run passes with 100×4 coverage and zero lint
      warnings.
- [x] Candidate selection fails closed when multiple nodes have the same
      highest recovered sequence number. Hostname ordering is not used as
      recovery authority.
- [x] Recovery authorization requires distinct, identified quorum-member
      acknowledgements. Numeric counts and duplicate acknowledgements are rejected.
- [x] Authenticated peer data is checked against the expected node
      identity before it enters recovery planning or epoch creation.
- [x] An already-active Primary peer produces a join-ready startup decision,
      so a member that starts after a clean shutdown does not use bootstrap authority.
- [x] Join verification requires the expected cluster identity, `Primary` view,
      `Synced` local state, readiness, and expected membership number.
- [~] Local lab runtime check: initialized three-node runs have completed
  health/readiness, start again, rejoin, and cluster-recovery scenarios, but the
  full recovery and backup workflow remains has live failures. SST/IST and
  post-recovery metadata consistency remain incompletely proven.
- [~] Quorum rejects stale observations, conflicting cluster identities, and
  conflicting Primary views, and the coordinator refuses assignment changes
  without quorum. Authenticated epoch-bound data, winner-only runtime
  bootstrap, and cold-recovery/lab validation remain open.
- [x] Ran the full local supervisor gates: tests, lint, typecheck, contracts,
      audit, syntax, and package dry-run. CI verification on Ubuntu and Windows
      remains a CI responsibility.
- [ ] Refresh release data and runtime/API/recovery documentation so previous
      candidate limitations are clearly historical rather than current claims.

## Verified or intentional boundaries

- [x] The supervisor configuration uses its local drain/lifecycle policy
      implementation. Client-side drain behavior remains owned by the client.

- [x] Supervisor owns Galera state, quorum, recovery authority, routing
      assignments, metadata administration, and the local root-socket SQL path.
- [x] `elera-client` remains a development/integration dependency only. The
      supervisor does not use it for administrative SQL.
- [x] Application-facing provisioning and SQL pool behavior remain outside
      supervisor, in CLI and client in order.
- [x] Authenticated routing bundle retrieval derives application, database, and
      identity from the runtime token context. Cross-application mismatches fail
      closed.
- [x] Core Flow remains generic and does not expose supervisor recovery
      internals.
