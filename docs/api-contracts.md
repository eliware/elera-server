# Elera Ecosystem API Contracts

This document is the shared contract reference for the Elera supervisor,
`@eliware/elera-lib`, and `elera-cli`. Endpoint status and the implementation
checklist are tracked separately in `docs/api.md`.

## System boundary

```text
application / elera-cli
        |
        v
HAProxy HTTP supervisor VIP
        |
        v
any supervisor node
        |
        +-- replicated elera_meta metadata
        +-- Elera health and routing decisions
        +-- credential leases

elera-lib receives a bundle and connects directly to eligible MariaDB nodes
```

HAProxy does not transmit MySQL traffic. The supervisor quorum selects eligible
nodes and assigns one writer to each application. `elera-lib` manages pools and
connection failover while the bundle is valid. It does not find Elera topology
or create writer assignments.

HTTP API is the management and recovery interface. The preferred routing channel
is an authenticated WebSocket through the same HTTP VIP:

```text
GET       /api/v1/routing/bundle[?identity=<root-token-selector>]
WebSocket /api/v1/routing/stream
POST      /api/v1/routing/resync
```

The stream transmits versioned routing snapshots, writer changes, drain and
recovery events, credential change notices, and heartbeats. It excludes
SQL. SQL uses direct MariaDB connections on port `3306`. If the stream fails,
the library reconnects with backoff and refreshes through HTTP API before the
current bundle expires.

Scoped bearer tokens are self-describing: the supervisor resolves the token's
application and identity (and so its database and credential) without
an identity query parameter. A root token may select an identity explicitly.
an identity selector that conflicts with a scoped token is rejected.

During graceful shutdown, the supervisor publishes a drain event and stops new SQL work.
It lets active queries and transactions complete, then closes the pools and MariaDB.
`elera-lib` stops selecting the draining node and chooses an ordered alternative.

## Supervisor configuration contract

GitOps supplies supervisor intent through a Kubernetes ConfigMap for
non-secret configuration and a Secret for tokens, passwords, TLS, and other
sensitive material. The supervisor renders the same MariaDB and Elera
files. Generated files are runtime artifacts, not a second configuration
source.

The reconciliation sequence is:

```text
load -> validate -> canonicalize -> hash -> render -> validate generated files
     -> atomically activate -> reload or controlled restart -> verify readiness
```

The MVP tracks needed and active hashes.
It retains a last-known-good rendered copy for recovery.

These hashes identify changes. Dynamic settings may use a graceful MariaDB reload.

Listener, Elera provider, cluster identity, or node identity changes require controlled startup.

Unsafe bootstrap changes require confirmation. Failed rendering or validation leaves the active configuration untouched.

GitOps Secrets/operator-managed inputs are the initial home for SSH keys,
`known_hosts`, TLS files, and backup configuration. The supervisor may store
age-encrypted artifact ciphertext and metadata in `elera_meta`, but it does not
store age private keys or decrypt artifacts.

## Compatibility and versioning

The API base path is:

```text
/api/v1
```

Every response includes `apiVersion` and must include a request identifier.
Breaking changes require a new API version.

## Authentication

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>

The bearer token is required in the WebSocket handshake `Authorization` header.
Query-string token authentication is not supported.
```

`ROOT_TOKEN` is a break-glass credential for first boot, cluster bootstrap,
metadata initialization, full restore, and token administration. It is not
stored in MariaDB.

Usual tokens are stored as hashes and are bound to resources and scopes.
Plaintext tokens are returned only once when created or rotated.

### SQL scopes

```text
connect  read  write  schema  execute  admin
```

### Management scopes

```text
token:read token:create token:revoke
database:read database:provision database:delete
account:read account:provision account:rotate account:revoke
credential:issue credential:refresh credential:revoke
metadata:read metadata:write
cluster:read cluster:operate
backup:read backup:create backup:restore
```

`primary` and `balanced` are routing policies, not permissions. Both may
accept writes in a Elera cluster.

## Response envelope

Correct response:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "ok": true,
  "requestId": "request-123",
  "operation": "credentials.lease",
  "status": "completed",
  "changed": false,
  "data": {}
}
```

Long-running response:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "ok": true,
  "requestId": "request-123",
  "operationId": "operation-123",
  "status": "running"
}
```

Error response:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "ok": false,
  "requestId": "request-123",
  "error": {
    "code": "UNSAFE_STATE",
    "message": "node is not eligible for bootstrap",
    "retryable": false,
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

Errors must not contain passwords, bearer tokens, private keys, or plaintext
encrypted artifacts.

## Common request rules

Mutating endpoints support:

```text
dryRun=true
timeoutMs=<bounded integer>
confirm=true
Idempotency-Key: <stable caller-generated key>
```

Dangerous operations require `confirm: true`. Idempotent operations return the
existing result when the same idempotency key is replayed.

## Connection bundle

The supervisor returns a connection bundle through a credential lease. It is a
policy decision, not a topology-discovery API for the client.

```json
{
  "leaseId": "lease-123",
  "identity": "billing-runtime",
  "database": "billing",
  "credentials": {
    "username": "billing_runtime",
    "password": "short-lived-secret"
  },
  "routes": {
    "primary": [
      { "host": "sql0.internal", "port": 3306, "weight": 100 },
      { "host": "sql1.internal", "port": 3306, "weight": 80 }
    ],
    "balanced": [
      { "host": "sql0.internal", "port": 3306, "weight": 100 },
      { "host": "sql1.internal", "port": 3306, "weight": 80 },
      { "host": "sql2.internal", "port": 3306, "weight": 60 }
    ]
  },
  "bundleVersion": 42,
  "refreshAfter": "2026-08-26T20:00:00Z",
  "expiresAt": "2026-08-26T21:00:00Z"
}
```

`elera-lib` sends writes only to ordered writer candidates and may use reader
entries for reads. It may use unexpired entries for pool balancing and
connection-level failover, but it must not invent a new writer assignment. It
must refresh when the bundle is stale, expired, or all candidates fail. It
must not automatically retry an in-flight mutation with unknown sending
status.

Transactions remain pinned to one connection and one route. Unknown or
ambiguous SQL defaults to the primary route.

## Credential lease contract

Request:

```json
{
  "database": "billing",
  "identity": "billing-runtime",
  "routes": ["primary", "balanced"]
}
```

Response: the connection bundle above.

Lease operations:

```text
POST /api/v1/credentials/lease
POST /api/v1/credentials/refresh
POST /api/v1/credentials/revoke
GET  /api/v1/routes
```

The API may return credentials directly more than authenticated TLS or return an
encrypted envelope, but durable records must contain ciphertext only.

## Managed resources

### Database

```json
{
  "name": "billing",
  "owner": "billing",
  "charset": "utf8mb4",
  "collation": "utf8mb4_unicode_ci",
  "state": "active"
}
```

### Identity

```json
{
  "name": "billing-runtime",
  "database": "billing",
  "purpose": "runtime",
  "scopes": ["connect", "read", "write"],
  "state": "active"
}
```

### Token

```json
{
  "name": "billing-runtime-token",
  "subject": "billing",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "resource": "identity/billing-runtime",
      "scopes": ["credential:issue", "credential:refresh"]
    }
  ],
  "expiresAt": null,
  "state": "active"
}
```

### Structured grants

```json
{
  "identity": "billing-runtime",
  "database": "billing",
  "grants": [
    {
      "scope": "billing.*",
      "privileges": ["SELECT", "INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The supervisor generates SQL from structured grants. Arbitrary grant SQL is
reserved for explicit recovery-import paths.

## Encrypted artifacts

```json
{
  "name": "billing/runtime-credential",
  "kind": "mysql-credential",
  "ciphertext": "age-encrypted-data",
  "keyVersion": "kops-2026-01",
  "checksum": "sha256:..."
}
```

The artifact store contains age-encrypted ciphertext and metadata. The age
private key remains with the CLI/operator or deployment Secret and is not
persisted in `elera_meta`. SSH keys, `known_hosts`, TLS material, and backup
configuration are supplied from GitOps/operator inputs. They are not returned
by these endpoints.

The implemented operations are:

```text
GET    /api/v1/secrets              (backup:read)
GET    /api/v1/secrets/{name}       (backup:read)
PUT    /api/v1/secrets/{name}       (backup:create)
DELETE /api/v1/secrets/{name}       (backup:restore)
POST   /api/v1/secrets/{name}/verify (backup:read)
```

Ciphertext must use the age armored format. There is deliberately no
decrypt/plaintext endpoint.

## Internal supervisor observations

Supervisor-to-supervisor requests use a dedicated scoped supervisor token:

```text
GET  /api/v1/internal/health
GET  /api/v1/internal/topology
POST /api/v1/internal/observations
```

Observations include the observer, subject node, sequence, timestamp,
readiness, Elera state, eligibility, and weight. Observations expire and must
not override local safety checks.

## Restore contract

Metadata and account restoration are logical operations. Raw restoration of
the `mysql`, `sys`, `performance_schema`, or `information_schema` files is not
the usual path.

```text
1. Restore elera_meta metadata
2. Restore encrypted artifact rows
3. Decrypt locally with the age key
4. Recreate application databases
5. Recreate MariaDB identities
6. Reapply structured grants
7. Verify connectivity and privileges
8. Restore application schemas and data with native commands
9. Verify application access
```

Large dump streams remain local to `elera-cli`. They do not pass through the
supervisor API as JSON.

## Operation contract

```json
{
  "operationId": "operation-123",
  "type": "accounts.reconcile",
  "status": "running",
  "requestId": "request-123",
  "requestedBy": "billing-cli-token",
  "createdAt": "2026-08-26T19:00:00Z",
  "completedAt": null,
  "result": null
}
```

Operation results are redacted and do not contain secret material.

```text
GET  /api/v1/operations
GET  /api/v1/operations/{operationId}
POST /api/v1/operations/{operationId}/cancel
```

## Historical implementation sequence

This sequence records the initial vertical-slice plan. It remains as project history.
It does not state that the steps remain pending or require this order.
The current status appears in `docs/feature-checklist.md`.

```text
1. Contract schemas and shared validation
2. elera-lib static primary/balanced client
3. Supervisor metadata initialization
4. Database/account/identity provisioning
5. elera-cli provisioning commands
6. Scoped token management
7. Credential leases and connection bundles
8. elera-lib bundle refresh and local failover
9. Encrypted artifacts and reconciliation
10. Metadata-first restore
11. Supervisor synchronization
12. HTTP-only VyOS HAProxy migration
```

## Current async operation contract

Supervisor operations that require more than one request return `202` and a queued operation ID.
The response includes `apiVersion: "v1"` and `ok: true`.
Operation states are `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`.

Clients poll `GET /api/v1/operations/{operationId}` with bounded exponential backoff.
They use an overall deadline and no more than 30 attempts. A completed response includes the result.
A failed response uses the same envelope with `ok: false` and a stable error string.

The same idempotency key returns the initial operation and result. A reused key with a different request fails.
The first migration milestone uses the existing synchronous application, database, identity, token, and status APIs.
It does not require a migration endpoint or an asynchronous operation resource.
