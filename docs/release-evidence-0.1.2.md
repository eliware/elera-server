## Build and verification

Build from the repository root with `docker build -f Dockerfile .`. Run
`npm test`, record the source commit, create the SBOM and vulnerability
report, publish by immutable digest, and independently verify that digest
before updating GitOps.

## Rollback and limitations

Rollback uses the previous approved image digest and matching GitOps commit.
Do not enable initialization during rollback.
The image does not repair stale or corrupted data.
It does not claim SST/IST or Kubernetes failure behavior until the isolated lab results are attached.
