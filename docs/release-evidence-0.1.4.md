This candidate contains the non-bootstrap startup hardening and the
Kubernetes-style runtime-path validation.

| Item                        | Status                      | Data                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Source commit               | Required at release         | Record the exact commit used to build the image.                                                                                     |
| Image digest                | Required at release         | Record and independently verify the registry digest after publication.                                                               |
| Runtime identity            | Verified locally            | UID 100 / GID 101 (`mysql`).                                                                                                         |
| Runtime mounts              | Verified locally            | `/run/elera`, `/run/mysqld`, `/tmp`, and `/var/lib/mysql` are writable as required. `/etc/elera` is static configuration.            |
| Bootstrap safety            | Verified locally            | Empty data with bootstrap disabled fails closed. Explicit bootstrap is required. Initialized data restarts without reinitialization. |
| Read-only root              | Verified locally            | Image starts with a read-only root filesystem and read-only `/etc/elera/supervisor.yaml` when runtime mounts are supplied.           |
| Application tests           | Verified locally            | `npm test`: 100×4 coverage, zero lint warnings.                                                                                      |
| Image build                 | Verified locally            | Elera, HAProxy, and backup/NAS lab images build successfully.                                                                        |
| New cluster safety          | Verified locally            | All three new nodes refuse implicit bootstrap during ordinary startup.                                                               |
| MariaDB/Galera versions     | Build input                 | MariaDB 12.3.3 and Galera 4 from the configured repositories.                                                                        |
| SBOM and vulnerability scan | Required at release         | Create and inspect final registry-image reports.                                                                                     |
| Signing and attestation     | Required at release         | Attach and independently verify image signature and provenance.                                                                      |
| Real Galera lifecycle tests | Pending platform validation | SST/IST, quorum loss, recovery, and Kubernetes lifecycle testing remain platform/lab gates.                                          |

## Rollback

Use the previous approved image digest and matching deployment revision. Do not
enable bootstrap during rollback or regular start again.
